# Contribution
You can contribute to this project in the following ways:
1. By creating beautiful designs of the Game Board
2. By writing and reviewing codes
3. By suggesting new features
4. By reporting issues
5. By updating the Readme file

# Versioning
V1.0
* This version would be made available for multiplayers only. The code for a single player playing against the computer would be made available in the subsequent releases.
* The flow of play could be any of the following:
	* 2 players playing remotely (this requires a connection to the server)
	* 2 players playing on the same device by taking turns
	* 2 players playing against each other over the LAN
	* 2 players playing against each other through bluetooth
* Only the first option would be available in this version. The second option would be available in the next major release.

# Sectioning
This project would be divided into different sections as follows:
1. The UI
2. The Controller
3. The Back end

### The UI
As the purpose of this project is to teach ReactJS, the UI would be centralized on the React framework. People working in this section would have a good knowledge of the React basics including how to create reuseable Components and how to write clean and understandable codes.

### The Controller
The game controller for this project would also be written in ReactJS. Close attention would be paid to the management of the UI to ensure an efficient program. The Redux library would be used to maintain the game states. In the initial versions, the Fetch API would be used to communicate with the server whereby, React Query would come in as a replacement for both the Redux library and Fetch API.

### The Back end
The API endpoint for this project would be written in PHP/MySQL and NodeJS/MongoDB. The team working on this section should be able to write clean, classical, testable, efficient and performant code.
